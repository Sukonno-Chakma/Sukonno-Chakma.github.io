### Coding 
I started learning coding in mid-2024 as a casual hobby, driven by my interest in technology and its applications. I am gradually learning and try to code whenever I have free time. In addition to coding, I enjoy playing open-world and MMORPG games. Inspired by my interest in gaming, I have built some websites around two of my favorite games, with a bit of help from others and AI along the way.
