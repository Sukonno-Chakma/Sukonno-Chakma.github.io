  **Project 1 (Group): Inspection of short-term Chlorophyll Change in the Arabian Sea: A spaceborne
assessment of Tropical Cyclone Impacts**  
  **Type:** Research Project (Remote Sensing & Oceanography Lab)

  - Nine out of ten cyclones showed increased chlorophyll concentration, with pre-monsoon cyclones producing stronger enhancements.
  - Cyclone intensity had only a negligible positive correlation with chlorophyll increase (r = 0.13).
  - Translation speed showed a moderate negative correlation (r = â€“0.41), meaning slower cyclones drive greater chlorophyll blooms.
  - Exceptional cases (like Hikaa and Luban) suggest other environmental or data-related factors also play roles.

  **Project 2: Tropical Cyclone Vulnerability Assessment of the Eastern Coast of Bangladesh** <br>
  **Type:** B.Sc. Research Project

  - Vulnerability mapping used 11 spatial criteria, covering elevation, slope, land use, population density, literacy, and access to shelters/roads.
  - About 32% of the study area was found to be at very high risk, especially in Mirsharai, Sandwip, Sitakunda, and Kutubdia.
  - Social vulnerability is highest where population density is high and literacy is low, compounding risks for women and disabled populations.
  - Mitigation capacity (shelters, healthcare, road networks) reduces risk in some regions, but gaps remain that require urgent infrastructure and community interventions.
