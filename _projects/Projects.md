    ## Project 1: Chlorophyll Change in the Arabian Sea  
    **Title:** Inspection of Short-term Chlorophyll Change in the Arabian Sea  
    **Type:** Research Project (Remote Sensing & Oceanography Lab)   

    - Nine out of ten cyclones showed increased chlorophyll concentration, with pre-monsoon cyclones producing stronger enhancements.
    - Cyclone intensity had only a negligible positive correlation with chlorophyll increase (r = 0.13).
    - Translation speed showed a moderate negative correlation (r = â€“0.41), meaning slower cyclones drive greater chlorophyll blooms.
    - Exceptional cases (like Hikaa and Luban) suggest other environmental or data-related factors also play roles.

    ## Project 2: Tropical Cyclone Vulnerability in Bangladesh  
    **Title:** Tropical Cyclone Vulnerability Assessment of the Eastern Coast of Bangladesh  
    **Type:** B.Sc. Research Project    

    - Vulnerability mapping used 11 spatial criteria, covering elevation, slope, land use, population density, literacy, and access to shelters/roads.
    - About 32% of the study area was found to be at very high risk, especially in Mirsharai, Sandwip, Sitakunda, and Kutubdia.
    - Social vulnerability is highest where population density is high and literacy is low, compounding risks for women and disabled populations.
    - Mitigation capacity (shelters, healthcare, road networks) reduces risk in some regions, but gaps remain that require urgent infrastructure and community interventions.
